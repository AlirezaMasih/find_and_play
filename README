fap - Search and Play Media Files

Usage:
  fap [name] [type] [path]

Arguments:
  name  - File name or number of days for file modification search.
  type  - 'f' for file search (default), 'd' for directory search.
  path  - Directory to search in (defaults to $HOME/Music).

How It Works:
1. If 'name' is a number (e.g., 3), searches for files modified within the last X days.
2. If 'name' is a string, searches for files or directories containing that name.
3. Files are played using VLC.

Examples:
- Search for a file and play:
  fap "song.mp3" f $HOME/Music

- Search for files modified in the last 3 days:
  fap 3 f $HOME/Music

- Search for directories with "Music" in the name:
  fap "Music" d $HOME
